          <h3>Definition</h3>
          <p>A linear function is a polynomial of degree 1 (or 0 sometimes) characterized by its appearance as a straight line.</p>

          <h3>Slope</h3>
          <p>The slope of a linear function is the vertical change in the function over the horizontal change in the function. The slope of a linear function defines how slanted or steep the function is. Unlike in other functions, the slope of a linear function is constant.</p>

          <h3>Slope-point form</h3>
          <p>One of the most common forms for expressing linear functions is slope-point form. Slope point form is generally expressed in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the function and b is the vertical intercept of the function at x = 0.</p>

          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>If a Java user suffers an initial amount of depression from using Java of 8 depression values, and acquires another 4 levels of depression for every successive hourly use of Java, how depressed will a developer using Java be after 12 hours?</p>
          <p style="margin: 30px 30px;">The initial amount of depression that the Java user suffers is 8, therefore this can be thought of as the y-intercept of some function d(h) which gives the amount of depression per hour. Each successive hour programmed garners 4 more depression, so this can be thought of as the slope of the function as slope is equal to change in d over change in h and the change in h is 1. Therefore, the function d(h) = 4h + 8. We can determine the depression value after 12 hours by computing d(12) = 4(12) + 8 = 56.</p>
